This package is in extremely early development.
Consider this more of a placeholder than an actual package.

# Setting up your dev environment:
First you must install the web assembly development toolchain for rust.
Do so with the following command in a terminal:
```
rustup target add wasm32-wasi
```

That's it. You're ready to go.

# Creating your project

Working on that.
